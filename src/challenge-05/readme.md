# Unique Elements Counter

## Summary
In an effort to create an optimized storage and indexing algorithm for an inventory process, your development team requires a specific method implementation. Following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), you are tasked to construct a function whose sole responsibility is to count the number of unique elements in a given list.

## Problem Description
The goal of this function is to take in a list of elements, and efficiently compute and return the quantity of unique values present within this list. This functionality is crucial to the efficiency of the storage and indexing algorithm.

## Tasks
Given a list of elements, your task is to implement a function that returns the count of unique elements in the list.

## Input
The function receives a list of integers as input.

**Example**
```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7]
```

## Output
The function should return an integer that represents the count of unique elements present in the list.

**Example**
```
Output: 7
```

## Function Signature
Please complete the function provided in your code editor. This function should take in a list of integers and return the count of unique elements present within the list.
